# IMPORTANT: you must be using the same dataset and the same number of taxa added at each update step
# IMPORTANT: make sure file_split_num is the same as for the run which generated the alignments
# IMPORTANT: If gon_phy_alignments="OFF" then a complete gon_phyling run will be used
# IMPORTANT: if gon_phy_alignments="/path/to/gon_phy_alignments_folder" then no new gon_phyling will be run
